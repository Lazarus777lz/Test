        In addition, there is a more urgent need to recognize the fact that AI is positively 
        transforming society than to worry about AI: in life, for example, Google predicts 
        that the search engine will be able to pre-set advice for people as soon as they start 
        typing, and in medicine, IBM's Watson computers can provide treatment alternatives even 
        for easily diagnosed patients by mining patient data ( Lidströmer et al 2022), and in 
        the economic field, intelligent cities are even touted as the solution to all problems (Mehta & Yadav). </p>

      <p>
        It is thus evident that in the age of big data, the use of AI is becoming more and more widespread 
        to the extent that, as Lidströmer (2022) and others put it, "wherever we look around, AI deep 
        learning or machine learning powers many things and provides services to people.</p>

        <b>Assumptions about the dilemma caused by AI - Introduction</b>
        <br>
        As for Tan and Lim's (2018) hypothesis of the occupational dilemma that 
        humans may be replaced by powered machines, thus creating a "useless class"
        mentioned in their study, it's undoubtedly one-sided.

      <p>
        <b>Assumptions about AI-induced dilemmas - Analysis 1 (Limitations of AI)</b>
        <br>
        Firstly, this statement overestimates the intelligence of AI. Tyson and 
        Zysman (2022) point out that current AI can only replace humans in repetitive 
        low-level cognitively demanding tasks, and humans still dominate in high-level 
        cognitively demanding tasks such as designing reasoning, knowledge of reality, 
        judgment, and social interaction. Secondly, as technology advances, lagging 
        occupations are bound to disappear, and AI only accelerates the process (Tyson & Zysman 2022).

        <b>Hypotheses about AI causing dilemmas - Analysis 2 (AI's pioneering nature)</b>
        <br>
        On the other hand, although the emergence of AI does crowd out some low-skilled 
        jobs if people are accurately instructed and trained, AI can not only help people 
        solve some long-standing problems, but it can also become a new field of employment 
        for mankind: for example, in the field of speech recognition, people can achieve 
        improved speech recognition in low-resource languages by using languages with a 
        small amount of labeled data ( Lidströmer et al 2022), and the healthcare sector 
        is urgently recruiting people who can master the principles of AI because of the 
        introduction of AI technologies (Lidströmer et al 2022).

        <b>Hypotheses about the dilemmas caused by AI - Conclusion 3 (Benefits from AI)</b>
        <br>
        In conclusion, as a disruptive technology, AI is impacting the status quo of the human labor market while at the same time urging people to face this technological change head-on and facilitate the iteration of technological updates and optimization of the workforce.
