        From hypothesis to the most important technology in the world today, the potential of AI is being exploited 
        for use at a rate several times faster, to the point where AI is ubiquitous in life, with coverage in a 
        variety of different fields, including healthcare, marketing, robotics, the stock market, business analytics,
        transport, surveillance, and more (Lidströmer et al 2022).

        Because AI can accurately mimic almost any aspect of human learning or other features of intelligence, it 
        is customary to focus attention on assessing whether AI is potentially dangerous as it transitions to 
        intelligent beings (Burgard 2022 pp. 11-18), even to the point of fearing that evolving AI will generate
        self-minds (Durt 2022, pp. 67-82) and fearing that AI will crowd out human producer jobs and create 
        unemployment dilemmas (Tan & Lim 2018).

        Admittedly, the blurring of the boundaries between AI and humans
        was gradually realized as early as 1950 in the Turing Test proposed by Alan Turing (Durt 2022), and the 
        billionaire industrialist Elon Musk has claimed that AI is a fundamental existential risk to humanity (Tan & Lim 2018).

          Nevertheless, the reality is that this claim is not rigorous, with Durt (2022) pointing out that the concept 
          of AI pushed by people who believe that AI can give birth to self-awareness stems more from science 
          fiction than concrete research.

          "It is misleading to define AI as something that mimics or replicates human intelligence," 
          Huxor (2022) also explains further around the Turing Test, "The Turing Test treats all AI 
          systems as a 'medium'- -a medium that allows humans to externalize their intelligence and 
          communicate with others, rather than autonomous intelligent agents," and she argues that 
          people are over-interpreting the purpose of the Turing Test because they are unfamiliar 
          with AI.</p>

        <p>
          Although AI is capable of processing large amounts of data and knowledge, it lacks human 
          experience, feelings, and understanding of situations (Hanemaayer 2022). Based on this foundation, 
          it can be concluded that Ai is still fundamentally different from human beings.
